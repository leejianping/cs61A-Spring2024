### Dog Data[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw10#dog-data "Direct link to Dog Data")

In each question below, you will define a new table based on the following tables.

    CREATE TABLE parents AS  SELECT "abraham" AS parent, "barack" AS child UNION  SELECT "abraham"          , "clinton"         UNION  SELECT "delano"           , "herbert"         UNION  SELECT "fillmore"         , "abraham"         UNION  SELECT "fillmore"         , "delano"          UNION  SELECT "fillmore"         , "grover"          UNION  SELECT "eisenhower"       , "fillmore";CREATE TABLE dogs AS  SELECT "abraham" AS name, "long" AS fur, 26 AS height UNION  SELECT "barack"         , "short"      , 52           UNION  SELECT "clinton"        , "long"       , 47           UNION  SELECT "delano"         , "long"       , 46           UNION  SELECT "eisenhower"     , "short"      , 35           UNION  SELECT "fillmore"       , "curly"      , 32           UNION  SELECT "grover"         , "short"      , 28           UNION  SELECT "herbert"        , "curly"      , 31;CREATE TABLE sizes AS  SELECT "toy" AS size, 24 AS min, 28 AS max UNION  SELECT "mini"       , 28       , 35        UNION  SELECT "medium"     , 35       , 45        UNION  SELECT "standard"   , 45       , 60;

Your tables should still perform correctly even if the values in these tables change. For example, if you are asked to list all dogs with a name that starts with h, you should write:

    SELECT name FROM dogs WHERE "h" <= name AND name < "i";

Instead of assuming that the `dogs` table has only the data above and writing

    SELECT "herbert";

The former query would still be correct if the name `grover` were changed to `hoover` or a row was added with the name `harry`.

### Q1: By Parent Height[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw10#q1-by-parent-height "Direct link to Q1: By Parent Height")

Create a table `by_parent_height` that has a column of the names of all dogs that have a `parent`, ordered by the height of the parent dog from tallest parent to shortest parent.

    -- All dogs with parents ordered by decreasing height of their parentCREATE TABLE by_parent_height AS  SELECT "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

For example, `fillmore` has a parent `eisenhower` with height 35, and so should appear before `grover` who has a parent `fillmore` with height 32. The names of dogs with parents of the same height should appear together in any order. For example, `barack` and `clinton` should both appear at the end, but either one can come before the other.

    sqlite> select * from by_parent_height;herbertfillmoreabrahamdelanogroverbarackclinton

Use Ok to test your code:

    python3 ok -q by_parent_height

### Q2: Size of Dogs[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw10#q2-size-of-dogs "Direct link to Q2: Size of Dogs")

The Fédération Cynologique Internationale classifies a standard poodle as over 45 cm and up to 60 cm. The `sizes` table describes this and other such classifications, where a dog must be over the `min` and less than or equal to the `max` in `height` to qualify as `size`.

Create a `size_of_dogs` table with two columns, one for each dog's `name` and another for its `size`.

    -- The size of each dogCREATE TABLE size_of_dogs AS  SELECT "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

The output should look like the following:

    sqlite> select * from size_of_dogs;abraham|toybarack|standardclinton|standarddelano|standardeisenhower|minifillmore|minigrover|toyherbert|mini

Use Ok to test your code:

    python3 ok -q size_of_dogs

### Q3: Sentences[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw10#q3-sentences "Direct link to Q3: Sentences")

There are two pairs of siblings that have the same size. Create a table that contains a row with a string for each of these pairs. Each string should be a sentence describing the siblings by their size.

    -- Filling out this helper table is optionalCREATE TABLE siblings AS  SELECT "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";-- Sentences about siblings that are the same sizeCREATE TABLE sentences AS  SELECT "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";

Each sibling pair should appear only once in the output, and siblings should be listed in alphabetical order (e.g. `"barack and clinton..."` instead of `"clinton and barack..."`), as follows:

    sqlite> select * from sentences;The two siblings, barack and clinton, have the same size: standardThe two siblings, abraham and grover, have the same size: toy

> **Hint**: First, create a helper table containing each pair of siblings. This will make comparing the sizes of siblings when constructing the main table easier.
> 
> **Hint**: If you join a table with itself, use `AS` within the `FROM` clause to give each table an alias.
> 
> **Hint**: In order to concatenate two strings into one, use the `||` operator.

Use Ok to test your code:

    python3 ok -q sentences

### Q4: Low Variance[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw10#q4-low-variance "Direct link to Q4: Low Variance")

We want to create a table that contains the height range (difference between maximum and minimum height) of all dogs that share a fur type. However, we'll only consider fur types where each dog with that fur type is within 30% of the average height of all dogs with that fur type.

For example, if the average height for short-haired dogs is 10, then in order to be included in our output, all dogs with short hair must have a height of at most 13 and at least 7.

To achieve this, we can use `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG`. For this problem, we'll want to find the average height and make sure that:

*   There are no heights smaller than 0.7 of the average.
*   There are no heights greater than 1.3 of the average.

Your output should first include the fur type and then the height range for the fur types that meet this criteria.

    -- Height range for each fur type where all of the heights differ by no more than 30% from the average heightCREATE TABLE low_variance AS  SELECT "REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR SOLUTION";-- Example:SELECT * FROM low_variance;-- Expected output:-- curly|1

_Explanation_: The average height of long-haired dogs is 39.7, so the low variance criterion requires the height of each long-haired dog to be between 27.8 and 51.6. However, `abraham` is a long-haired dog with height 26, which is outside this range. For short-haired dogs, `barack` falls outside the valid range (check!). Thus, neither short nor long haired dogs are included in the output. There are two curly haired dogs: `fillmore` with height 32 and `herbert` with height 31. This gives a height range of 1.

Use Ok to test your code:

    python3 ok -q low_variance
