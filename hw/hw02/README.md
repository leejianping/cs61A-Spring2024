Several doctests refer to these functions:

from operator import add, mul

square = lambda x: x * x

identity = lambda x: x

triple = lambda x: 3 * x

increment = lambda x: x + 1

Higher-Order Functions
Q1: Product
Write a function called product that returns the product of the first n terms of a sequence. Specifically, product takes in an integer n and term, a single-argument function that determines a sequence. (That is, term(i) gives the ith term of the sequence.) product(n, term) should return term(1) * ... * term(n).

def product(n, term):
    """Return the product of the first n terms in a sequence.

    n: a positive integer
    term:  a function that takes one argument to produce the term

    >>> product(3, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3
    6
    >>> product(5, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    120
    >>> product(3, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    36
    >>> product(5, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2 * 4^2 * 5^2
    14400
    >>> product(3, increment) # (1+1) * (2+1) * (3+1)
    24
    >>> product(3, triple)    # 1*3 * 2*3 * 3*3
    162

Use Ok to test your code:

python3 ok -q product

Q2: Accumulate
Let's take a look at how product is an instance of a more general function called accumulate, which we would like to implement:

def accumulate(fuse, start, n, term):
    """Return the result of fusing together the first n terms in a sequence 
    and start.  The terms to be fused are term(1), term(2), ..., term(n). 
    The function fuse is a two-argument commutative & associative function.

    >>> accumulate(add, 0, 5, identity)  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    15
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 5, identity) # 11 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    26
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 0, identity) # 11 (fuse is never used)
    11
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)   # 11 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2
    25
    >>> accumulate(mul, 2, 3, square)    # 2 * 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    72
    >>> # 2 + (1^2 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (3^2 + 1)
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: x + y + 1, 2, 3, square)
    19
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"


accumulate has the following parameters:

fuse: a two-argument function that specifies how the current term is fused with the previously accumulated terms
start: value at which to start the accumulation
n: a non-negative integer indicating the number of terms to fuse
term: a single-argument function; term(i) is the ith term of the sequence
Implement accumulate, which fuses the first n terms of the sequence defined by term with the start value using the fuse function.

For example, the result of accumulate(add, 11, 3, square) is

add(11,  add(square(1), add(square(2),  square(3)))) =
    11 +     square(1) +    square(2) + square(3)    =
    11 +     1         +    4         + 9            = 25

Assume that fuse is commutative, fuse(a, b) == fuse(b, a), and associative, fuse(fuse(a, b), c) == fuse(a, fuse(b, c)).

Then, implement summation (from lecture) and product as one-line calls to accumulate.

Important: Both summation_using_accumulate and product_using_accumulate should be implemented with a single line of code starting with return.

def summation_using_accumulate(n, term):
    """Returns the sum: term(1) + ... + term(n), using accumulate.

    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, square)
    55
    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, triple)
    45
    >>> # This test checks that the body of the function is just a return statement.
    >>> import inspect, ast
    >>> [type(x).__name__ for x in ast.parse(inspect.getsource(summation_using_accumulate)).body[0].body]
    ['Expr', 'Return']
    """
    return ____

def product_using_accumulate(n, term):
    """Returns the product: term(1) * ... * term(n), using accumulate.

    >>> product_using_accumulate(4, square)
    576
    >>> product_using_accumulate(6, triple)
    524880
    >>> # This test checks that the body of the function is just a return statement.
    >>> import inspect, ast
    >>> [type(x).__name__ for x in ast.parse(inspect.getsource(product_using_accumulate)).body[0].body]
    ['Expr', 'Return']
    """
    return ____


Use Ok to test your code:

python3 ok -q accumulate
python3 ok -q summation_using_accumulate
python3 ok -q product_using_accumulate

Q3: Make Repeater
Implement the function make_repeater that takes a one-argument function f and a positive integer n. It returns a one-argument function, where make_repeater(f, n)(x) returns the value of f(f(...f(x)...)) in which f is applied n times to x. For example, make_repeater(square, 3)(5) squares 5 three times and returns 390625, just like square(square(square(5))).

def make_repeater(f, n):
    """Returns the function that computes the nth application of f.

    >>> add_three = make_repeater(increment, 3)
    >>> add_three(5)
    8
    >>> make_repeater(triple, 5)(1) # 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 1
    243
    >>> make_repeater(square, 2)(5) # square(square(5))
    625
    >>> make_repeater(square, 3)(5) # square(square(square(5)))
    390625

Exam Practice
Here are some related questions from past exams for you to try. These are optional. There is no way to submit them.

Note that exams from Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 gave students access to an interpreter, so the question format may be different than other years. Regardless, the questions below are good problems to try without access to an interpreter.
