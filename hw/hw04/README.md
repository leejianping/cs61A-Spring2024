### Q1: Deep Map[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw04#q1-deep-map "Direct link to Q1: Deep Map")

Write a function `deep_map` that takes a list `s` and a one-argument function `f`. `s` may be a nested list, one that contain other lists. `deep_map` modifies `s` by replacing each element within `s` or any of the lists it contains with the result of calling `f` on that element.

`deep_map` returns `None` and should not create any new lists.

> **Hint:** `type(a) == list` will evaluate to `True` if `a` is a list.

    def deep_map(f, s):    """Replace all non-list elements x with f(x) in the nested list s.    >>> six = [1, 2, [3, [4], 5], 6]    >>> deep_map(lambda x: x * x, six)    >>> six    [1, 4, [9, [16], 25], 36]    >>> # Check that you're not making new lists    >>> s = [3, [1, [4, [1]]]]    >>> s1 = s[1]    >>> s2 = s1[1]    >>> s3 = s2[1]    >>> deep_map(lambda x: x + 1, s)    >>> s    [4, [2, [5, [2]]]]    >>> s1 is s[1]    True    >>> s2 is s1[1]    True    >>> s3 is s2[1]    True    """    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

Data Abstraction[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw04#data-abstraction "Direct link to Data Abstraction")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Acknowledgements**

This problem is based on one from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs [Section 2.2.2](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-15.html#%25_sec_2.2.2).

![Mobile example](https://www.learncs.site/assets/images/mobile-planet-cd451bb90fa15d86f7f3a5d9ed3e12db.png)

We are making a planetarium mobile. A [mobile](https://www.northwestnatureshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AMSolarSystem.jpg) is a type of hanging sculpture. A binary mobile consists of two arms. Each arm is a rod of a certain length, from which hangs either a planet or another mobile. For example, the below diagram shows the left and right arms of Mobile A, and what hangs at the ends of each of those arms.

![Labeled Mobile example](https://www.learncs.site/assets/images/mobile-planet-labeled-0aa7b6fa45c14f0ba3e66000770637e4.png)

We will represent a binary mobile using the data abstractions below.

*   A `mobile` must have both a left `arm` and a right `arm`.
*   An `arm` has a positive length and must have something hanging at the end, either a `mobile` or `planet`.
*   A `planet` has a positive mass, and nothing hanging from it.

Below are the implementations of the various data abstractions used in mobiles. The `mobile` and `arm` data abstractions have been completed for you.

_Implementation of the Mobile Data Abstraction_ (**for your reference, no need to do anything here**):

    def mobile(left, right):    """Construct a mobile from a left arm and a right arm."""    assert is_arm(left), "left must be an arm"    assert is_arm(right), "right must be an arm"    return ['mobile', left, right]def is_mobile(m):    """Return whether m is a mobile."""    return type(m) == list and len(m) == 3 and m[0] == 'mobile'def left(m):    """Select the left arm of a mobile."""    assert is_mobile(m), "must call left on a mobile"    return m[1]def right(m):    """Select the right arm of a mobile."""    assert is_mobile(m), "must call right on a mobile"    return m[2]

_Implementation of the Arm Data Abstraction_ (**for your reference, no need to do anything here**):

    def arm(length, mobile_or_planet):    """Construct an arm: a length of rod with a mobile or planet at the end."""    assert is_mobile(mobile_or_planet) or is_planet(mobile_or_planet)    return ['arm', length, mobile_or_planet]def is_arm(s):    """Return whether s is an arm."""    return type(s) == list and len(s) == 3 and s[0] == 'arm'def length(s):    """Select the length of an arm."""    assert is_arm(s), "must call length on an arm"    return s[1]def end(s):    """Select the mobile or planet hanging at the end of an arm."""    assert is_arm(s), "must call end on an arm"    return s[2]

### Q2: Mass[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw04#q2-mass "Direct link to Q2: Mass")

Implement the `planet` data abstraction by completing the `planet` constructor and the `mass` selector so that a planet is represented using a two-element list where the first element is the string `'planet'` and the second element is its mass.

    def planet(mass):    """Construct a planet of some mass."""    assert mass > 0    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"def mass(p):    """Select the mass of a planet."""    assert is_planet(p), 'must call mass on a planet'    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"def is_planet(p):    """Whether p is a planet."""    return type(p) == list and len(p) == 2 and p[0] == 'planet'

The `total_mass` function demonstrates the use of the mobile, arm, and planet abstractions. You do **NOT** need to implement anything here. **You may use the `total_mass` function in the following questions.**

    def examples():    t = mobile(arm(1, planet(2)),               arm(2, planet(1)))    u = mobile(arm(5, planet(1)),               arm(1, mobile(arm(2, planet(3)),                             arm(3, planet(2)))))    v = mobile(arm(4, t), arm(2, u))    return t, u, vdef total_mass(m):    """Return the total mass of m, a planet or mobile.    >>> t, u, v = examples()    >>> total_mass(t)    3    >>> total_mass(u)    6    >>> total_mass(v)    9    """    if is_planet(m):        return mass(m)    else:        assert is_mobile(m), "must get total mass of a mobile or a planet"        return total_mass(end(left(m))) + total_mass(end(right(m)))

Run the `ok` tests for `total_mass` to make sure that your `planet` and `mass` functions are implemented correctly.

Use Ok to test your code:

    python3 ok -q total_mass

### Q3: Balanced[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw04#q3-balanced "Direct link to Q3: Balanced")

Implement the `balanced` function, which returns whether `m` is a balanced mobile. A mobile is balanced if both of the following conditions are met:

1.  The torque applied by its left arm is equal to the torque applied by its right arm. The torque of the left arm is the length of the left rod multiplied by the total mass hanging from that rod. Likewise for the right. For example, if the left arm has a length of `5`, and there is a `mobile` hanging at the end of the left arm of total mass `10`, the torque on the left side of our mobile is `50`.
2.  Each of the mobiles hanging at the end of its arms is itself balanced.

Planets themselves are balanced, as there is nothing hanging off of them.

> **Reminder:** You may use the `total_mass` function above. Don't violate abstraction barriers. Instead, use the selector functions that have been defined.

    def balanced(m):    """Return whether m is balanced.    >>> t, u, v = examples()    >>> balanced(t)    True    >>> balanced(v)    True    >>> p = mobile(arm(3, t), arm(2, u))    >>> balanced(p)    False    >>> balanced(mobile(arm(1, v), arm(1, p)))    False    >>> balanced(mobile(arm(1, p), arm(1, v)))    False    >>> from construct_check import check    >>> # checking for abstraction barrier violations by banning indexing    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'balanced', ['Index'])    True    """    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

    python3 ok -q balanced

### Q4: Maximum Path Sum[​](https://www.learncs.site/docs/curriculum-resource/cs61a/homework/hw04#q4-maximum-path-sum "Direct link to Q4: Maximum Path Sum")

Write a function that takes in a tree and returns the maximum sum of the values along any root-to-leaf path in the tree. A root-to-leaf path is a sequence of nodes starting at the root and proceeding to some leaf of the tree. You can assume the tree will have positive numbers for its labels.

    def max_path_sum(t):    """Return the maximum root-to-leaf path sum of a tree.    >>> t = tree(1, [tree(5, [tree(1), tree(3)]), tree(10)])    >>> max_path_sum(t) # 1, 10    11    >>> t2 = tree(5, [tree(4, [tree(1), tree(3)]), tree(2, [tree(10), tree(3)])])    >>> max_path_sum(t2) # 5, 2, 10    17    """    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

Use Ok to test your code:

    python3 ok -q max_path_sum
